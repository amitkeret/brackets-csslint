Issues/Updates
=====
[11/12/2012] Update code to properly insert the content over the status bar. Also made it resizable.  
[9/26/2012] Escape HTML in the message. Fix width issue. Thanks to Randy Edmunds for the reports.

Per feedback from Narciso Jaramillo, I use a checkbox to show enabled/disabled status and move to the item when you click a row.
